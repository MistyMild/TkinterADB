# TkinterADB
ADB that is built out of (you guessed it) Python and Tkinter.

# What is this about?
This little project is something I was bored about. 

This features a tiny bit of ADB Commands, such as adb devices, adb reboot bootloader, adb reboot recovery, and much more?
This also has a built-in ADB executor, but adb has to be in Environment Variables (I know, pretty useless.)

#Enjoy!
